                     This was McGregor debut to UFC and needing to make an splash into the scene if he was to continue growing his audience from Cage warriors. Although his debut McGregor looked incredibly comfortable, throwing loose and fast shots while weaving in and out of oncoming blows, Brimage stood no chance. After a swift first round knockout this was the start of McGregors knockout reputation in UFC.

            As the only fight to break the pattern, this fight went for three rounds after max survived the first standing round he took it to the ground and tried to outwork McGregor, using varying guards to try find a weakness in McGregors game, however after McGregor passes and gains mount its all over for Max. A point of proof that Mcgregors ground game wasnt as bad as all the talk at the time suggested. He didnt earn his brown belt for nothing.

            This fight had alot of disscussion with Mendes being the first strong and renowned wrestler he woudl face, his defensive grappling skills were put to the test before he later landed a knockout like the rest of his opponents.

              The first round began. McGregor sidekicks the leg. Aldo comes in eating a counter straight left dropping unconscious, McGregor lands a right hammerfist and it's over. 10 years of Jose Aldos reign over in 13 seconds. The first of Mcgregors titles, the first record he would break, just as McGregor said he would from a young age he became the featherweight champion.
